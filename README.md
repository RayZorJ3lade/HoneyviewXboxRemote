# HoneyviewXboxRemote
Control the honeyview comic/manga reader with your Xbox360 controller.

Software Required: 
Honeyview - http://www.bandisoft.com/honeyview/ <br/>
Keysticks - http://keysticks.net

Setup - in the honeyview config menu define the following keys:

n - next image<br/>
p - previous image<br/>
] - skip forward 10 images<br/>
[ - skip back 10 images<br/>

Copy the 'P34 - Honeyview.keyx' file in this repo into the keysticks profile directory and activate it. 
I have set it to use an empty config by default and only activate if it detects Honeyview running.
