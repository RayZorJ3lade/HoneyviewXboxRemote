# HoneyviewXboxRemote
Control the honeyview comic/manga reader with your Xbox360 controller.

Software Required: 
Honeyview - http://www.bandisoft.com/honeyview/
Keysticks - http://keysticks.net

Setup - in the honeyview config menu define the following keys:

n - next image
p - previous image
] - skip forward 10 images
[ - skip back 10 images

Copy the P34 - Honeyview.keyx into the keysticks profil directory and activate it. 
I have set it to use an empty config by default and only activate if it detects Honeyview running.
